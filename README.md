# Food Calorie Meter
A Deep Learning approach<hr>

<h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
We present a system which can recognize the contents of your meal from a single image, and then predict its calories. The simplest version assumes that the user(student) is eating at the college canteen for which we know the menu. In this case, we can collect images ofﬂine to train a multi-label classiﬁer  using a CNN-based classiﬁer.
In this case, we need to estimate the size of the foods. This requires solving segmentation and depth-volume estimation from a single image. We present CNN-based approaches to solve these problems.

<h4>Tech Stack Used:</h4>
Python, Flask and OpenCV
